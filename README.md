e. **Project Achievements**:
We were able to achieve all of the project requirements. That said, we are running this locally because Storm limits to 4 ssh sessions, and we needed 6.

f. **Setup Instructions**:
Unzip the file (it is a standard tgz file). Then, enter the `src/` directory and run `javac peerProcess.java`, then `java peerProcess <peerID>` for each peer.
